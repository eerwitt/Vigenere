## Vigenère Cipher in Coffeescript

Do not use this for anything other than fun. The actual implementation is in [vigenère.coffee](./vigenère.coffee) with some example tests to show how it works. There is also a helper file which deals with checks for valid input and splitting up the message and keys to a 1-26 value instead of the UNICODE value.
